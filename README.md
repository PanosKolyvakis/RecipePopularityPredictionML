# RecipePopularityPredictionML

This is a simple machine learning predictive modelling project in which the popularity of a recipe is predicted based on how much time a user spends on a website. 

The prediction relies on building a classification model that labels any sample as 'high' or 'low' traffic based on several features such as calories, nutritional data (carbs , sugar etc) , number of servings in recipe, and types of food (chicken , vegetables etc)
